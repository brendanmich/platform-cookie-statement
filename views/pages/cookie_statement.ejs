					<br><h2>
						What are cookies?
					</h2>
					<p>
						Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
						Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or
						services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Our Wave) are called "first-party
						cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies".
						Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the
						website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third
						parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website
						or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.
					</p>

					<!-- Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies? -->
					<br><h2>
						Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?
					</h2>
					<p>
						We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical
						reasons in order for our Our Wave Partner Sites and Service to operate, and we refer to these as "essential"
						or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track
						and target the interests of Visitors to our Our Wave Partner Sites, and we refer to these as "performance" or
						"functionality" cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send
						or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Our Wave Partner Sites
						and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Service we provide. Finally, third parties serve
						cookies through our Our Wave Partner Sites and Service for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
						This is described in more detail below.

					<br><h3>
						Other tracking technologies
					</h3>
					<p>
						We and our third-party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like SDKs,
						pixels (or "clear gifs") and other tracking technologies. Pixels are tiny graphics files that
						contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Our Wave Partner Sites or,
						in the case of SDKS, visited our Apps. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of
						Visitors from one page within our Our Wave Partner Sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies,
						to understand whether you have come to our Our Wave Partner Sites from an online advertisement displayed on a
						third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site
						performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to
						specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are
						reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair
						the functionality of these technologies.
					</p>

					<!-- Targeted online advertising -->
					<br><h2>
						Targeted online advertising
					</h2>
					<p>
						We have engaged one or more third-party service providers to track and analyze both individualized usage
						and volume statistical information from interactions with our Our Wave Partner Sites. We also partner with
						one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to display advertising on our
						Our Wave Partner Sites and/or to manage and serve advertising on other sites.
					</p>
					<p>
						These third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and
						use certain information about your online activities, either on our Our Wave Partner Sites and/or other sites
						or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored
						to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests ("Interest Based Advertising"). For
						more information about this practice, click here:
						<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our third-party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your
						visits to our Our Wave Partner Sites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements
						and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one
						of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information
						that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Facebook:</b> We also use the pixel function of Facebook Custom Audiences to identify users who have
						landed on certain pages for the purposes of target group-orientated remarketing and advertising.
						The Facebook pixel stores a cookie, which means that information about your visit to our Our Wave Partner Site
						will be shared with Facebook. Also, as part of the "advanced matching" undertaken by Facebook, other
						personal information (such as telephone number, email address, Facebook ID) may be shared with Facebook
						in a protected (hashed) form. These cookies and the information collected are used to create target
						groups to help Facebook deliver advertising on our behalf to users who have previously visited our
						Our Wave Partner Site when they are on Facebook or a digital platform powered by Facebook Advertising, and to
						track advertising success. You can modify your Facebook Ad settings to restrict these advertisements.
						Navigate to Settings/Adverts in your Facebook account to adjust your preferences. Learn more about the
						different types of Facebook cookies here:

					<br><h2>

					<p>
						You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Website Cookie Preference Tool:</b> You can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our
						Our Wave Partner Sites by visiting our cookie settings preference center, available at the
						<a href="<%- locale.localePath %>/cookie-statement#settings">bottom of this page</a>. You can also exercise your Our Wave Partner Site
						cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link:
						<a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Browser Controls:</b> You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you
						choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Our Wave Partner Sites though your access to some
						functionality and areas of our Our Wave Partner Sites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse
						cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s
						help menu for more information.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:</b> Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of
						Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit
						<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or
						<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Mobile Advertising:</b> You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain
						types of Interest Based Advertising, including those performed by us, by accessing the settings
						in your Apple or Android mobile device and following the most recent published instructions. If you
						opt out, we will remove all data about you and no further data collection or tracking will occur.
						The random ID we (or our third-party partners) had previously assigned to you will also be removed.
						This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt-in, we will not be able to continue and track
						you using the same ID as before, and you will for all practical purposes be a new end user to our system.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Do Not Track:</b> Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability
						to transmit "Do Not Track" or "DNT" signals. Since uniform standards for "DNT" signals have not been
						adopted, our Our Wave Partner Sites, Connected Sites, Landing Pages, and Websites do not currently process
						or respond to "DNT" signals. Our Wave takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make
						efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of
						a standard. To learn more about "DNT", please visit
						<a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">All About Do Not Track</a>.
